# üß™ Food Pathogen Risk Simulator

A scientific web application for simulating the growth and risk level of foodborne pathogens based on environmental and handling variables. Built with Streamlit, this tool helps food safety professionals and researchers assess potential risks in food handling scenarios.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Real-time pathogen growth modeling using the Gompertz growth model
- **Risk Assessment**: Color-coded risk level indicators (Low, Medium, High) with specific recommendations
- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Food type selection (Poultry, Dairy, Produce, Seafood)
  - Temperature control monitoring (0-50¬∞C)
  - Time abuse tracking (0-72 hours)
  - pH level analysis (3.5-7.5)
  - Water activity measurement (0.85-1.0)
- **Visual Analytics**: Dynamic growth curve visualization with Plotly
- **Data Export**: Download simulation results as CSV for further analysis
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant feedback on parameter changes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## üìä Scientific Background

The simulator uses a modified Gompertz growth model to predict pathogen population growth based on environmental conditions. The risk assessment takes into account:

- Temperature abuse patterns and their impact on growth rates
- pH levels and their effect on microbial growth
- Water activity (aw) measurements and their influence on pathogen survival
- Time duration of exposure to risk factors
- Initial contamination levels and their progression
- Food matrix characteristics and their impact on growth

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
